# Matchlot Casino Game Using Javascript


Welcome to the Matchlot Casino Game! This is a simple web-based game implemented using JavaScript, where players can place bets on different combinations of alphabets on a spinning wheel. The goal is to predict the outcome of the spinning correctly and win rewards based on the matching combinations.

## How to Play

### Deposit Balance: 
Before you can start playing, you need to deposit some balance into your account. Enter the amount you want to deposit.


### Place a Bet: 
After depositing the balance, you can place a bet on one or more of the three rows of alphabet combinations available on each line of the spinning wheel: "ABC," "DEF," and "XYZ." Enter the amount you want to bet and select the combination you're predicting. Click the "Place Bet" button.


### Spin: 
Once you've placed your bet, click the "Spin" button. The slot will spin and eventually come to a stop, revealing the combinations on each line.

### Check for Win: 
If any line on the wheel shows the combination you predicted, you win! The game will calculate your reward based on your bet amount and the odds for the specific combination.

### Collect Rewards: 
If you win, your account balance will be updated with the reward amount. If you lose, the bet amount will be deducted from your balance.

### Continue Playing: 
You can continue playing as long as you have enough balance in your account to place bets. If your balance goes below the minimum bet amount, you won't be able to play until you deposit more funds.

## Game Rules

You cannot place a bet higher than your current account balance.
The odds and rewards for each combination will also be shown to you.
